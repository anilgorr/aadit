Check whether sensitive data also appears in logs, analytics, test systems or support tickets, where ownership may be less clear than in the primary application.",

An external payment provider can reduce some responsibilities without eliminating every requirement around integration and the systems affecting it.

Important releases and changes to payment integrations should prompt a review of whether previous testing still covers the relevant paths.",
